# Winner - Cognitive Builder Faire, New york -2017 Hackathon
## Sponsored by IBM, Foursquare, and Galvanize

## Challenge:
Build a cognitive(AI) application to address a social challenge using IBM watson and Foursquare.

## Problem Statement:
The process of drug approval can be a lengthy one.It takes an average of 15 years for an experimental drug to go from lab to patient. One of the main bottle neck in this process is **patient recruitment**.Despite heavy spending on recruitment, according to a 2011 Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development (CSDD) report, two-thirds of sites donâ€™t meet the enrollment requirements for a given trial. Failing to meet these goals causes delays in clinical trials that end up costing even more money. Even though there are many candidates willing to participate in these clinical trials, most of them are not aware of right trails.

## Our Solution
Addressing the above problem, we have build a conversational-agent(chatbot) using IBM watson, Microsoft Bot framework, Microsoft Computer vision API, and Foursquare API. The bot automatically recognizes potential candidates near areas of interests, like cancer research centers, chemotherapy centers etc. using foursquare API and initiate a conversation. The bot would that get required info from the candidate and connect them to appropriate trials. Thus, making recruitement process more personalized and efficient.
